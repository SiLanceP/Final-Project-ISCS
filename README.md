Topic: File-sharing peer-to-peer blockchain for university use in storing educational materials

Schools and universities usually depend on centralized systems to store and share learning materials, assignments, and academic records.

However, these systems can run into problems like data breaches, loss of information, and being too dependent on a single server. This makes it hard for teachers and students to make sure their files are authentic, secure, and truly owned by them.

It also makes tracking version history and individual contributions more difficult, which is important for maintaining fairness and integrity in academics.

We propose a decentralized blockchain-based file management system that can help solve these issues by making files tamper-proof, transparent, and easy to verify, while allowing teachers and students to share and access materials securely without relying on one central authority.
