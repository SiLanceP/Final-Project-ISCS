So from what i found that we cant use the application to actually have a decentralized file-to-file sharing because of the gas limit problem in blockchain
however with IPFS, we can technically have like achieve this
IPFS: https://icommunity.io/en/what-is-ifps-the-hard-drive-for-blockchain/#:~:text=Protects%20data%20reading%20from%20all,Smart%20contract

to keep it within Blockchain, best we can do is just sharing links that can lead them to the file (which is stored in cloud storage, i.e. Google Drive)
