So from what i found that we cant use the application to actually have like file to file sharing because of the gas limit problem in blockchain
however with IPFS, we can technically have like actual files to be shared
IPFS: https://icommunity.io/en/what-is-ifps-the-hard-drive-for-blockchain/#:~:text=Protects%20data%20reading%20from%20all,Smart%20contract

to keep it within Blockchain, best we can do is just sharing links that can lead them to the file (which is stored in cloud storage, i.e. Google Drive)
